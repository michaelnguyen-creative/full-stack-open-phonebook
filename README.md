# Project: Phonebook App
Restructure phonebook app from Full-Stack Open part3 (frontend) & part4 (backend) projects as a mono-repo

## Project goals:
- Develop a CI/CD pipeline for legacy code
- Practice code refactoring & software configuration management (webpack etc.)

App deployed at https://damp-morning-4577.fly.dev/

*Note: Refactoring follows instructions & project template from Full-stack-open part 7's [example app](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/create-app)*
